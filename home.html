      <h3>HI THERE !</h3>
      <h1>I'am <span>Ansuman Tripathy</span></h1>
      <p>Business coaches are typically experienced entrepreneurs and business owners themselves who decide to use their talents for building and growing a business to help other business owners reach their goals.</p>
      <p>If you’re tired of getting a single paycheck every month, now is the perfect time to pursue multiple income streams of your own. Whether you want to become an entrepreneur or not, having more than one income stream is always a good idea. <br> Maybe you need extra money to pay down debt. Or, perhaps you want to save up to buy a new home. Whatever your goals, having more money can help you get there faster. And, who knows? Your “side hustle” may even become your full-time job one day.   <br>Income rolling in from all over the place sounds great, right? Unfortunately, it’s hard enough for some people to figure out how to create a single income stream.</p>

          <span>2017 - 2019</span>
          <h3>10th and 12th Grade</h3>
          <p>On March 2017 I completed my 10th boards from an ICSE School which is "SAINT PAUL'S SCHOOL" in Rourkela and at the same school i completed my 12th Grade. I hade a good marks and enjoyed the best of my childhood days in Rourkela.</p>

          <span>2019 - 2023</span>
          <h3>B-Tech in Computer Science Engineering</h3>
          <p>As i have taken Science in my 12th and i have got a great intrest in Computer Programming so i decided to take Engineering as my Career and yes i also wanted to go into Amazon haha. So i got admission in C.V Raman College and with that i was also participated in the rat race where all other engineers were.</p>

          <h3>Direct Selling</h3>
          <p>In this world of Dogmatism where every other person is obsessed with Engineering or Doctor, i got a chance to stand out from everyone and start someting new of my own. So i joined OK LIFE CARE which is a Direct Selling company and with all these i got a new start in my life. i got a great mentor who is always there with me and i can proudly say that i have a team of more than 70+ Members in my team and i am on the way to become a good Direct Seller one day.</p>

          <h3>Trading</h3>
          <p>Earning Money and saving it for the future is good, but what i feel is when u have a great platfom like Investing then you should be a part of it. The Money Denomination is rising every 5 years so what ur saving is not going to be worth it after 5 or 10 years. So i learned trading from one of my Mentor who taught me everything about this Stock Market and i was a bit excited in the first month till i made a loss. then i thought no reading books on it and taking more knowledge about Trading and now when i have made a good profit i can say that the future is Investing. So i suggest each and everyone to be invested.</p>
